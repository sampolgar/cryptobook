# Quadratic Expression
- multiplication of 2 linear expressions, can include addition or subtraction of another linear expression
- linear expression = 1 degree `3x + 5`, `a - 2b + 4`, `7y`. Either constant or constant * variable. No square/cube
- quadratic constraint = each term is either a constant, a single signal, or the product of exactly two signals.
